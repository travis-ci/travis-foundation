      <h2>We are Travis Foundation</h2>
      <p>Travis Foundation is a non-profit initiative aiming to give back and pay forward to the Open Source community.</p>
      <p>Travis CI has always been very much rooted in Open Source. Working with the community to build a service for the community has been one wild love and success story. Since Travis CI now is an established, solid service, it is time to give back even more.</p>
      <p>With Travis Foundation we will use our expertise to support projects that provide opportunities to newcomers, foster diversity and make the community an even greater place in general.</p>
