As a surprise for all our friends and followers we created an [Advent Calendar on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/tfadventcalendar?f=tweets&vertical=default&src=hash) for you. Every day we tweeted recommendation what was good this year regarding feminism, diversity or open source. We got way way more recommendations from friends & family of the Foundation than we could include (we definitely need a longer advent calendar!), so here we are sharing all whooping 74 recommendations with you (if you have additions that made your year, share them in the comments with us!) — Happy Holidays!
