    Every year, our annual report will give an overview of the work we've done and goals we've reached with each project. The chosen format of the Social Reporting Standard makes this report useful for donors and volunteers, as well as newcomers to our work, who wish to know not just what we do but, first and foremost, what we can achieve.
